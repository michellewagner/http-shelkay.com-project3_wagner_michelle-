            <h3 class="crafts1">Unicorn Puppets</h3>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Materials</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">silver cardstock, 3/4 inch circle punch, small google eyes, multi colored yarn, hole punch, pink marker, scissors, tacky glue, glue stick</p>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Directions</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">1. From your white heavy cardstock, cut out a unicorn body, neck and head, and two ears. See the picture collage below for reference. Cut out a shiny silver horn from your silver cardstock. 2. Punch four 3/4-inch holes in the bottom of the unicorn body with your circle punch. These are the puppet holes for your fingers.3. Glue the unicorn head and neck onto the body. Then glue on your ears and unicorn horn.4. Cut several small pieces of multi-colored yarn. Put a line of tacky glue along the back of the unicorn neck and right at the top of the head and glue on all of your yarn pieces. 5. Punch out a hole at the end of the unicorn body with your hole punch so you can attach a tail. Cut a strand of yarn, probably about a foot long. I just cut it to a length where I had several different colors showing. Fold the piece of yarn in half. Thread the folded end of the yarn up through the tail hole so that you’ll have a loop. Thread the other end of the yarn through the loop and pull it closed tightly around the tail hole. See picture collage above for reference. Cut off any excess yarn at the end of the tail. 6. Finish your playful unicorn puppets by gluing on a googly eye and using your pink marker to draw a nostril and mouth on your unicorn.</p>

            <h3 class="crafts1">Unicorn Matchbox Notebook</h3>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Materials</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">one matchbox, white paper/light card, paper scraps for decorating, glue, wool/yarn in Unicorn colours, rainbow paper colours or white paper for the Notebook, scissors, pens</p>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Directions</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">Begin by wrapping your match box in white paper – if the paper is very thin, you may need two layers.  The quickest way of doing this, is to wrap your uncut paper around the matchbox and crease along the edges to get your measurements. Then cut out the paper, reinforce the creases and glue onto your matchbox. You now have a “blank canvas” to decorate as a unicorn! Instead of paper you can paint the matchbox white too!Cut out the following features: a horn, an oval “mouth piece”, triangles for the ear. We used gold paper for the horn, but aluminium foil would look just as sparkly. Draw the ear outline onto your matchbox. We decided a ratio of 2/3 to 1/3 background to unicorn design would be nice.And colour in the background blue or green. Glue your ear, horn and mouth piece in place. Finally, add some nice big Unicorn eyes to your unicorn face.It is time to add the unicorn’s mane. I used some bright pink and blue wools. Cut 2x 4 strands for the fringe (approx 2cm long) and a set of varying lengths for the mane. Carefully glue the fringe in place. Then the mane. Let dry fully.Whilst your unicorn is drying, you can make your mini notebook to go inside your matchbox. The quickest way, is to cut two strips of white paper (to fit snuggly into the matchbox). Then glue these together, to make one long continuous strip. Concertina this paper and pop it into the matchbox. Done. If you would rather make a Rainbow Notebook to go into your Unicorn Matchbox (who wouldn’t!!). Cut strips of paper in rainbow colour – they need to be the width of the matchbox x TWO TIMES the length + a little bit. Fold to match the length, with the “little bit” peeping over. Use this paper lip to glue it onto the next colour of your notebook. And repeat until you have all the desired colours. It takes a little longer, but looks oh so cute. Pop into your matchbox and your DIY Matchbox Unicorn Notebook is finished! Woohoo.</p>

            <h3 class="crafts1">Unicorn Rocks</h3>
              <p class="crafts1">Position your oval low on the rock, to leave room for the horn. Start with the oval so that there is time to give it a couple of coats. Sometimes when you paint directly onto a rock, the rock seems to absorb the paint a bit. Giving it a second coat will give you a nice white look. If you want to give your rock a base coat.Sketch out the basic white shape of the ears. I rounded off the tops to give the unicorn a more gentle look…because unicorns are gentle animals, right! Next, add a smaller pink triangle to give the ears a pop of color. Draw a tall triangle for the horn. Using the black pen, you will give the horn a nice shape by drawing the rings.101 Tip!:  Sometimes the glitter pens seem very light. I’ve noticed that they darken as they dry. I like to start my flowers by adding the center dot first. Then you can quickly draw the petals around the center. When drawing the wavy hair, it helps to draw a small dot where you want the hair to end. This gives your hand a destination and you’re more likely to get the look you want. I gave my unicorn rocks 3 layers of hair, but you can add as many or as few as you like. The hardest part of this painted rock is drawing the face. I started by drawing the two nostrils. Then I lined up the inside corner of the eye with the nostril. I also turned my rock upsidedown as I painted. This is because I paint arches better than I draw “U” shapes. Practice drawing your unicorn face on a piece of paper first.Once everything is painted, give your unicorn rock some definition by painting black around all the edges.</p>

            <h3 class="crafts1">DIY Unicorn Valentine Paper Puppet</h3>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Materials</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">white craft paper, colored marker pens, scissors, glue</p>
            <h5 class="crafts1">Directions</h5>
              <p class="crafts1">1. Fold a square piece of paper diagonally and cut a rounded corner at one end, as shown in the image. 2. Unfolding this will give you a heart shape. Now cut some more shapes out of white paper – a rectangle for the mane, a ‘long’ triangle for the horn and a petal shape for the ear. 3. Use your colored markers to color in the mane and the horn. Use any pattern or combination of colors. Go for pink markers to do the inner ear. 4. To give the mane a more realistic look, snip the colored part into thin strips, making sure you don’t cut all the way through the paper. 5. Time to fix the unicorn’s head! Take the heart shape from earlier and place it with the pointy part facing upward. 6. Fold the curved parts inward on the left side, as shown in the images below. 7. Now turn the heart over, so you have the folded portion on the right side now. This is the unicorn’s face. 8. Stick the mane on the straight left edge of the heart, making sure the glued part is underneath. Stick the horn on the top and the ear on the pointy edge of the heart. 9. Time to finish up your unicorn! Fix flowers or any other embellishments of your choice, draw some facial features and your pretty unicorn is ready!</p>

                <h5 class="crafts1">Materials</h5>
                  <p class="crafts1">school glue, table salt, table salt, food coloring, paintbrushes, white or colored cardstock, printable unicorn template <a href="https://sweettmakesthree.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kids-watercolor-salt-painting-unicorn-template.pdf" target="_blank">Printable Template</a></p>
                <h5 class="crafts1">Directions</h5>
                  <p class="crafts1">Step 1 – Print template onto cardstock and apply a thick layer of glue over the template as shown below. Use your finger or a paintbrush to spread it evenly. Step 2 – Sprinkle salt over glue and shake off gently. Step 3 – Mix your colors! Note that there’s waaay too much water in each of these cups. I had to pour half of it out and add more food coloring for it to be bold enough. Also, don’t even bother with trying to mix purple. It turns brown just like with purple Kool-Aid Easter eggs. Step 4 – Time to paint! Dip a brush into the water then touch it to the salt and watch it spread.</p>
