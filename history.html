  									<h2>Legendary Creature</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers, including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, Aelian and Cosmas Indicopleustes. The Bible also describes an animal, the re'em, which some versions translate as unicorn.</p>

  									<h2>European Folklore</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>In European folklore, the unicorn is often depicted as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long horn and cloven hooves (sometimes a goat's beard). In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin. In the encyclopedias, its horn was said to have the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as unicorn horn. The unicorn continues to hold a place in popular culture. It is often used as a symbol of fantasy or rarity.</p>

  									<p>A number of seals seemingly depicting unicorns have been found from the Indus Valley Civilisation. Seals with such a design are thought to be a mark of high social rank. These have also been interpreted as representations of aurochs—a type of large wild cattle that formerly inhabited Europe, Asia and North Africa—or derivatives of aurochs, because the animal is always shown in profile, indicating there may have supposed to have been another horn, which is not seen.</p>

  									<h2>Greek Mythology</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>Unicorns are not found in Greek mythology, but rather in the accounts of natural history, for Greek writers of natural history were convinced of the reality of unicorns, which they believed lived in India, a distant and fabulous realm for them. The earliest description is from Ctesias, who in his book Indika ("On India") described them as wild asses, fleet of foot, having a horn a cubit and a half (700 mm, 28 inches) in length, and colored white, red and black.</p>

                    <p>Ctesias got his information while living in Persia. Unicorns on a relief sculpture have been found at the ancient Persian capital of Persepolis in Iran. Aristotle must be following Ctesias when he mentions two one-horned animals, the oryx (a kind of antelope) and the so-called "Indian ass". Strabo says that in the Caucasus there were one-horned horses with stag-like heads. Pliny the Elder mentions the oryx and an Indian ox (perhaps a rhinoceros) as one-horned beasts, as well as "a very fierce animal called the monoceros which has the head of the stag, the feet of the elephant, and the tail of the boar, while the rest of the body is like that of the horse; it makes a deep lowing noise, and has a single black horn, which projects from the middle of its forehead.</p>

                    <p>Cosmas Indicopleustes, a merchant of Alexandria who lived in the 6th century, made a voyage to India and subsequently wrote works on cosmography. He gives a description of a unicorn based on four brass figures in the palace of the King of Ethiopia. He states, from report, that "it is impossible to take this ferocious beast alive; and that all its strength lies in its horn. When it finds itself pursued and in danger of capture, it throws itself from a precipice, and turns so aptly in falling, that it receives all the shock upon the horn, and so escapes safe and sound".</p>

  									<h2>Medieval Knowledge</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
                    <p>Medieval knowledge of the fabulous beast stemmed from biblical and ancient sources, and the creature was variously represented as a kind of wild ass, goat, or horse. The predecessor of the medieval bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of religious art.

  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
                    	<p>The unicorn also figured in courtly terms: for some 13th-century French authors such as Thibaut of Champagne and Richard de Fournival, the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of humanism, the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage. It plays this role in Petrarch's Triumph of Chastity, and on the reverse of Piero della Francesca's portrait of Battista Strozzi, paired with that of her husband Federico da Montefeltro (painted c. 1472–74).</p>

  									<p>The Throne Chair of Denmark is made of "unicorn horns" – almost certainly narwhal tusks. The same material was used for ceremonial cups because the unicorn's horn continued to be believed to neutralize poison, following classical authors. The unicorn, tamable only by a virgin woman, was well established in medieval lore by the time Marco Polo described them as "scarcely smaller than elephants. They have the hair of a buffalo and feet like an elephant's. They have a single large black horn in the middle of the forehead. They have a head like a wild boar's. They spend their time by preference wallowing in mud and slime.</p>

  									<p>The horn itself and the substance it was made of was called alicorn, and it was believed that the horn holds magical and medicinal properties. The Danish physician Ole Worm determined in 1638 that the alleged alicorns were the tusks of narwhals. Such beliefs were examined wittily and at length in 1646 by Sir Thomas Browne in his Pseudodoxia Epidemica. False alicorn powder, made from the tusks of narwhals or horns of various animals, has been sold in Europe for medicinal purposes as late as 1741. The alicorn was thought to cure many diseases and have the ability to detect poisons, and many physicians would make "cures" and sell them.</p>

In the series, richly dressed noblemen, accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against mille-fleur backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle.</p>

  									<p>A rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the hortus conclusus in religious art combined the Annunciation to Mary with the themes of the Hunt of the Unicorn and Virgin and Unicorn, so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the Incarnation and whether this meaning is intended in many prima facie secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel Gabriel is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father.</p>

  									<p>In heraldry, a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, as can be seen from the following gallery). Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed.</p>

  									<p>In heraldry the unicorn is best known as a symbol of Scotland: the Unicorn was believed to be the natural enemy of the lion - a symbol that the English royals adopted around a hundred years before[30] and was also chosen because it was seen as a proud and haughty beast which would rather die than be captured, just as Scots would fight to remain sovereign and unconquered. Two unicorns supported the royal arms of the King of Scots, and since the 1707 union of England and Scotland, the royal arms of the United Kingdom have been supported by a unicorn along with an English lion. Two versions of the royal arms exist: that used in Scotland gives more emphasis to the Scottish elements, placing the unicorn on the left and giving it a crown.</p>

Certain noblemen such as the Earl of Kinnoull were given special permission to use the unicorn in their arms, as an augmentation of honour. The crest for Clan Cunningham bears a unicorn head.</p>

The Japanese version (kirin) more closely resembles the Western unicorn, even though it is based on the Chinese qilin.

  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>Several unicorn skeletons also have been discovered, but all of them have been deemed fake. In the 1600s, German scientist and inventor Otto von Guericke created a fake unicorn skeleton with bones locals found in a cave. And a sketch based on the model was even included in a book on natural history written in the 1700s. Whether the original fake was created out of fun or the creator thought he was building a real unicorn is unknown.</p>

  									<h2>Unicorn Sightings</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>Many people claim to have seen unicorns in person. In 1991, Austrian naturalist Antal Festetics said he viewed a unicorn while horseback riding in the Harz Mountains, though he offered no proof of the encounter. And in 2010, the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto shared footage of a unicorn sighting, which was later deemed a hoax. In the footage, the unicorn's gait looks a bit wooden as it travels along, unlike the flowing gait of a horse.</p>

  									<h2>Creating Uncirons</h2>
  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>It is possible to manipulate the horn buds of cattle and goats—and probably other horned animals, as well—so they twist together to create the look of a unicorn. Similarly, the Prato unicorn, a deer with a single horn in the center of its head, was spotted in Italy in 2008. While rare, these things do happen, perhaps giving rise to the myth of the unicorn.</p>

  								</div>
  								<div class="wd-info-desc">
  									<p>One animal does come by its single horn honestly. The narwhal—or Monodon monoceros, which means "single-toothed whale"—has what appears to be a longhorn projecting from its forehead. In reality, this tooth protrudes through a gap in its upper lip. So it's not really a horn, and it's not entirely clear to scientists what this tusk is for.</p>

      <p>This one is probably the most intriguing fact we’ve seen… We do not recommend killing or harming unicorns, but hunting for them can be a lot of fun. To do that you will need an official “Unicorn Hunting License”. You can get your own Unicorn Hunting License for free at the Lake Superior University. This license is good for a lifetime (and beyond) and can be used anywhere on earth.</p>
